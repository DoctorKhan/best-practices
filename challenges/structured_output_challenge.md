### Project Request: Implementing Structured Outputs in LLM

**Objective:**
Develop a GitHub project to explore and implement structured outputs in Large Language Models (LLMs), using Pydantic models and ensuring strict output formats. The project should focus on generating structured outputs for mindfulness meditation scripts.

**Key Tasks:**

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository.
   - Ensure the repository includes a proper README, outlining the project's goals and implementation steps.

2. **Structured Outputs:**
   - Read and understand the challenge of producing structured outputs in LLMs as described in the OpenAI article [Introducing Structured Outputs in the API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/).
   - Implement a model that outputs structured data for a mindfulness meditation script. The output should follow the structure below:
     ```python
     {
         "duration": 45000,
         "focus_area": "relaxation",
         "phrases": [
             {"text": "Welcome to this meditation, take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.", "pause": "2000"},
             {"text": "Feel the air fill your lungs, and then release any tension or stress as you exhale.", "pause": "2000"},
             {"text": "Bring your attention to your body, starting from your toes and moving up to the top of your head.", "pause": "2000"},
             {"text": "As you breathe in, imagine fresh, calming energy entering your body.", "pause": "2000"},
             {"text": "As you breathe out, imagine any tension or stress leaving your body.", "pause": "2000"},
             {"text": "Allow your muscles to relax, starting from your toes and moving up to the top of your head.", "pause": "4000"},
             {"text": "Feel the weight of your body sinking into the ground, supported by the earth below.", "pause": "3000"},
             {"text": "Imagine yourself in a peaceful, safe place, surrounded by calm and serenity.", "pause": "4000"},
             {"text": "Stay here for a moment, breathing deeply and feeling the relaxation spread throughout your body.", "pause": "6000"},
             {"text": "When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, and take a deep breath in, feeling refreshed and renewed.", "pause": "2000"}
         ]
     }
     ```

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use **Pydantic models**.
   - Implement unit testing to validate the structure and correctness of the output.
   - Include error handling and refusal mechanisms for inputs that cannot be processed into structured outputs.

4. **Repository Management:**
   - Create a separate branch for development and merge into the main branch after code review.
   - Follow best practices in coding, documentation, and testing.
   - Ensure all updates are documented in the GitHub repository, including any changes made to the models or structure.

**Final Deliverable:**
- A well-documented GitHub repository containing the code, README, and unit tests that successfully generate structured outputs for mindfulness meditations.
